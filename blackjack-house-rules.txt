So, welcome to our Blackjack House! Above you'll find some rules
that we defined to understand how the game works:

1 - The deck is unlimited in size. 
2 - There are no jokers. 
3 - The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10. In the game they're represented by 10.
4 - The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
5 - Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
6 - The computer is the dealer.

Hope you enjoy this funny game. 
And, as I always say:
- Feel free to take the code and modify it the way you want.
